Virtual User
------------

It is an application written in python that gives you the power of controlling your computer using hand gestures without making use of hardware. It is based upon the technology of ***Image-Processing***.

You need to follow these three steps for getting started:
- Take three colored caps and put them on your fingers.
- On running first time, you need to do initial calibration for each color by poiniting one color before your pc camera at a time and hiding others.
- The calibration is done by clicking twice on the color such that a rectangle is formed(assume that you are clicking on opposite vertices of rectangle).
- Then, after calibrating a color right click on screen with other color before camera.
- Similary, you need to do this callibration thrice.
- After that just move a color before camera and you will see actions are performed such as left click, mouse move etc.

Now, only three actions are supported viz. mouse move, left click, right click and only on linux machines.Soon, it will be updated for windows and new actions such as scrolls etc.
